# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Model
>The aim of this project is to predict heart disease using machine learning algorithms.This project implements 3 classificiation models using scikit-learn: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbour to investigate their performance on heart disease datasets obtained from the Cleveland Heart Disease(UCI Repository) dataset.
