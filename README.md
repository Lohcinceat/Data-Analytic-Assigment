# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Model
The objective of this project is to utilize machine learning algorithms to predict the occurrence of heart disease. Three classification models, namely Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, are implemented using scikit-learn. The performance of these models is evaluated using heart disease datasets obtained from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset available in the UCI Repository. The project dataset is stored in the Heart Disease .csv file, and to explore the project, you can run the Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb file in Python.

# Data Analytic Heart Disease Prediction

This repository contains a data analytics project focused on predicting the occurrence of heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes three classification models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors, implemented using scikit-learn. The performance of these models is evaluated using heart disease datasets obtained from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset available in the UCI Repository.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop predictive models that can effectively identify the occurrence of heart disease based on various input features. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to create models that can assist in early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, thereby aiding in proactive healthcare management.

## Dataset

The project dataset is stored in the `Heart Disease.csv` file. This dataset contains a collection of features such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical attributes, which are used as input variables for the predictive models. The dataset is sourced from the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset available in the UCI Repository.

## Running the Project

To explore and run the heart disease prediction project, follow these steps:

1. Download and open the Jupyter Notebook `Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter or any compatible notebook environment.
2. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and explore the heart disease prediction models and analysis.
